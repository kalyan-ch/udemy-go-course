Central repo for all projects from udemy go course - includes notes

## Packages, Imports, Functions
* packages are more like a workspace - collection of similar or common source code files 
* packages can be reusable or executable
* executable file should be of package `main`
* executable package should contain a function `main`
* any other package name means it is of a reusable type
* `import` keyword to include a package into your current code
* functions are blocks of callable, reusable code 
* functions in go start with keyword - `func`

## Variables
* variables in go are statically typed
* but go compiler can infer the type based on code
* full syntax for variable declaration `var card string = "AS"`
* alternative syntax - `card := "AS"` - := only used to declare variables
* can declare variables outside a function but can't assign a value to it
